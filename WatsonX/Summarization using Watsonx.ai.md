# Summarize the document using Watsonx.ai

Watsonx.ai is an integral component of the IBM WatsonX platform, which seamlessly integrates cutting-edge generative AI capabilities, harnessed from foundational models and traditional machine learning, into a dynamic studio encompassing the entire AI development lifecycle. With Watsonx.ai, you have the capacity to effortlessly train, validate, fine-tune, and deploy generative AI, foundational models, and machine learning capabilities. This streamlined approach allows you to construct AI applications significantly less time and with reduced data requirements.

Summarization is a useful approach that enables us to effectively summarize extensive texts, emails, and chat conversations. In this blog, our primary focus is to demonstrate the application of Watsox.ai for chat summarization. We leverage the Watsonx.ai API within a Jupyter notebook to efficiently summarize interactions between agents and clients.
